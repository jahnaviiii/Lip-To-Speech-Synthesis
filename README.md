# lip-to-speech-synthesis

Employing 3D Convolutional Neural Networks, our project addresses lip-to-speech synthesis, merging visual lip movements with audio signals for natural speech generation. Our innovative approach enhances communication technologies across various applications, from assistive devices to multimedia content.
